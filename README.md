# FlickrPhotoDemo

App demonstrates using the Flickr API to get recent photos uploaded to the service. The app has the following features:
- Upon launch the app will attempt to download photos that have been recently uploaded to Flickr and display them in a grid
- If you want to attempt to retrieve a fresh batch of photos, just use the refresh icon on the toolbar
- If you want to view each image seperately by swiping, just choose the **Show Individual** menu item. In this mode you'll be able to see the image's title along with the image
- To switch back to the grid view, just choose the **Show Grid** menu item
- Clicking on an image will attempt to take you to that image in the device's browser.
